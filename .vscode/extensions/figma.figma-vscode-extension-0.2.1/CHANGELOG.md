## 0.2.1 - 22nd June 2023

### Fixed

- Clicking "Open in VS Code" now shows a login prompt if you are not already logged in to Figma for VS Code

### Notes

Figma for VS Code is not currently compatible with VS Code Insiders, though we're hoping to have support for this soon.

For now, we suggest using the regular VS Code version if you'd like to use Figma for VS Code
